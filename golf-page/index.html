                    <h2>My Golf Journey ⛳</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Anna, golf has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I began playing when I was really young, inspired by my grandpa, who was an excellent golfer and first introduced me to the game. What started as time spent at the course with family quickly grew into a lifelong passion.
                        I began competing in tournaments in 2020, which marked a turning point in my golf journey. Since then, I’ve continued to work on my skills, challenge myself, and grow as a player both on and off the course. Through dedication and countless hours of practice, I’ve now earned a spot on the University of Alberta Pandas golf team, a milestone I’m incredibly proud of.
                        This page is where I share my achievements, experiences, and progress as I continue my journey in competitive golf.</p>

                <h1> Where it began</h1>
                <p> I grew up golfing with my parents, my sister, and my grandfather, and some of my favorite family memories were made out on the course. Most of our time was spent at Hinton Golf Club or Edmonton Petroleum Country Club, where family time meant long rounds, friendly competition, and plenty of laughs. To keep us motivated, there were always a few bribes involved such as getting to drive the golf cart when we were little or earning the right for the winner to choose what we’d have for dessert after the round. Those days are what made golf feel less like a sport and more like a fun activity that brought our family closer together.</p>

                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>In 2020, I began playing beginner tournaments through McLennan Ross, a circuit that is incredibly welcoming to new golfers and does a great job introducing kids to a competitive environment. It was there that I quickly learned competitive golf was nothing like recreational golf—every shot carried more weight, and the mental side of the game mattered just as much as the physical. Mindfulness and visualization became crucial, and I realized how strongly my inner emotions controlled my performance on the course. After a bad shot, I had to learn how to reset and not let it spiral into a bad hole. My mom and I called this “the train”—once I was on it, everything could unravel fast. At the beginning, I wasn’t very good at getting off the train, but those early lessons shaped the player and person I am today.</p>

        <div class="text-container">
            <p>As I continued to play more tournaments, I slowly began to see real success. With experience, I got better at regulating my emotions, and “the train” started to shrink—from lasting a few holes, to just one hole, and eventually to a single shot. That mental growth made a huge difference in my scoring, and the results followed. In 2021, I placed first twice, and in 2022, I placed first three times, which was incredibly rewarding and validating.
                After that success, we decided to take the next step into the Maple Leaf Junior Tour (MJT), which felt like a big jump in the junior golf world. However, I struggled in my MJT events. I would completely psych myself out, convincing myself I wasn’t ready for that level of competition, and I’d find myself hopping right back onto the train I had worked so hard to stay off of. It was a humbling experience, but one that taught me just how powerful confidence and mindset are in competitive golf.</p>

                    <h2>Liz</h2>
                    <p>Liz has been one of the most important people in my golf journey, and someone I will always be deeply grateful for. She wasn’t just my golf coach, she guided me through every part of the game, from course management to the smallest swing technicalities, and I truly looked up to her both as a coach and as a person. 
                        Liz was always kind, funny, patient, and endlessly supportive, making every practice and tournament feel lighter. She believed in me before I believed in myself, and her encouragement pushed me to grow not only as a golfer, but as a person.
                        One of the biggest lessons Liz taught me was how to manage the mental side of golf, before, during, and after a round. She showed me that preparing for competition isn’t just about hitting balls, but about having a meaningful practice plan and a proper warm-up routine that sets you up for success. 
                        During a round, she emphasized staying present and intentional, treating each shot as its own moment with a clear purpose, smart targets, and confidence behind it. After a round, Liz taught me how to reflect honestly: identifying where I lost shots, what I did well, and how to use that information to build a better, more intentional practice schedule moving forward. 
                        Because of her, I learned how to practice with purpose rather than just going through the motions. I truly would not be the golfer, or the person I am today without Liz. She played a huge role in shaping my game, my mindset, and the way I approach challenges both on and off the course.</p>
