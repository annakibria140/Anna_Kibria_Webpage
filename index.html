                <h1> Anna Kibria </h1>
                <p> Hi, I’m Anna, welcome to my website. This space is a collection of the things I’m most passionate about, from exploring Edmonton’s food scene to tracking my progress and achievements on the golf course. Whether I’m trying a new restaurant or working on my swing, I love documenting the journey and sharing honest experiences along the way.</p>

                        <h2>Anna Eats 🍽️</h2>
                        <p>Anna Eats is my food blog where I explore and review restaurants around Edmonton. I share honest opinions on the food, atmosphere, and experience, along with photos and a growing map of every place I’ve visited and logged. The goal is to highlight local spots, discover new favourites, and help others find great places to eat.</p>
